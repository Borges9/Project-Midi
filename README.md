# Midi

The Midi project was made to put my javascript logic into practice, the panel is made up of buttons that emit instrument sounds when clicked.

<div align="center">
<img src = "https://github.com/Borges9/Prototipo-de-portifolio/assets/102422255/4f1bb246-a842-4ded-b027-d7cbc402b88b" width="700px" />
</div>

## Funcionality
<div align="center">

</div> 

Each button has a specific sound when clicked, there is also a button style transition when clicked.
